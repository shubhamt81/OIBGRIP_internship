        <p> Ratan Tata was born in Bombay, now Mumbai, during the British Raj on 28 December 1937, and is
        the son of Naval Tata (born in Surat). His biological maternal grandmother had been the sister of
        Hirabai Tata, wife of group founder Jamsetji Tata. His biological grandfather, Hormusji Tata, had
        belonged to the broader Tata family; Ratan therefore was a Tata by birth. His first language is Gujarati.

        He studied at the Campion School, Mumbai till the 8th class, followed by Cathedral and John Connon
        School, Mumbai and at Bishop Cotton School in Shimla, and, in 1955, graduated from Riverdale
        Country School in New York City. In 1959, he then received a degree in Architecture from
        Cornell University, and in 1975, attended the seven-week Advanced Management Program of Harvard 
        Business School â€” an institution which he has since endowed.

        In 1991, J. R. D. Tata stepped down as chairman of Tata Sons, naming him his 
        successor. When he settled down into the new role, he faced stiff resistance from many companies
        heads, some of whom had spent decades in their respective companies and rose to become very 
        powerful and influential due to the freedom to operate under JRD Tata. 
        Under his stewardship, overlapping operations in group companies were streamlined into a 
        synergised whole, with the salt-to-software group exiting unrelated businesses to take on 
        globalisation.

        During the 21 years he led the Tata Group, revenues grew over 40 times, 
        and profit, over 50 times. Where sales of the group as a whole, overwhelmingly came from 
        commodities when he took over, the majority sales came from brands when he exited. He 
        boldly got Tata Tea to acquire Tetley, Tata Motors to acquire Jaguar Land Rover and Tata Steel to
        acquire Corus. All this turned Tata from a largely India-centric group into a global business, 
        with over 65% revenues coming from operations and sales in over 100 countries. He
        conceptualised the Tata Nano car.
